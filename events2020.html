So, IEEE IAS organised an IEEE IAS distinguished Lecture delivered by <strong> Prof. Jose A. Antonino-Daviu </strong> from Universitat Politecnica de Valencia, Valencia, Spain. He delivered the lecture on the topic of <strong>monitoring and fault diagnosis of electric machines</strong>. This topic is not only in high demand among industries, but it also plays a critical role in supporting present infrastructure, which is heavily reliant on electrical gear. As a result, concepts of machine monitoring and problem detection needs to be combined to ensure that an industry runs smoothly.<br>

HST 2019 attracted 250 attendees, including 52 entrepreneurs that were given the opportunity to connect with investors. Investors, business professionals, and government officials were among the 42 distinguished speakers who discussed a variety of startup-related topics. The 4th edition of HST will bring together a slew of startup professionals and give businesses a reputable venue to propose their ideas for incubation assistance. IIT Mandi catalyst partnered with <strong>SB Chapter IIT Mandi</strong> for publicity, outreach, and other volunteer assistance. Although this three-day event was entirely virtual, our volunteers assisted as much as they could in conducting the talks, conference and many more.</p>

In this Ideathon, students in a group of 3 had to come up with an innovative tech-based solution that can bridge the gap and streamline the education system so that the learning can be more effective. The event began at 12 p.m. on December 19, 2020 and continued for 48 hours. Participants were required to come up with a solution on the theme <b>"Where education meets technology"</b> and present it using a two-minute video and a presentation. They were compelled to think of some innovative ideas that can really be implemented in this new normal. This event drew around 24 students. The core team members accompanied them throughout the event and offered assistance as required. The participants were ecstatic to be there. They were made to think out of the box. They also learnt how to first analyse all the prospects of an idea before implementing it.</p>
